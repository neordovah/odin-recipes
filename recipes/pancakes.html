    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>100g flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>300ml milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put 100g plain flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Make a well in the centre and crack 2 eggs into the middle</li>
        <li>Pour in about 50ml from the 300ml of milk and 1 tbsp sunflower oil then start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.</li>
        <li>Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream</li>
        <li>Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper</li>
        <li>Leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn</li>
        <p><strong><em>And now, for the most important step:</strong></em>
        <li><strong>Bonne apetit!</strong></li>
    </ol>
